# XploreTV2GO - Description

The main objective of the **XploreTV2GO** initiative is to disseminate experiences and tools for the easy creation of TV-compatible web applications.

Based on sample applications, which were gained in the course of the work around the question of meaningful service extensions for TV use, the provided tools and reference applications should support an easy entry into the development of contemporary TV web applications based on HTML5.

Based on current TV trends, the **XploreTV2GO** initiative addresses topics such as how and in what form significant added value can be generated for the TV user in the simplest possible way.

This innovative approach opens the door to a wide range of application scenarios, e.g. developers of conventional web presences can optimise their works for TV use.

The experience gained during the project development is revealed in the form of **XploreTV2GO** - Best Practices and UI requirements for here. 

The information provided is intended to guide potential third-party developers or their customers to make their web applications "ready for TV" simply and easily with the help of the **XploreTV2GO** examples.
